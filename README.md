# SSTURescale
A set of configs to make SSTU engines realistic in a ~10x rescale

Realism Overhaul is a few levels above the casual play style that I want, but I enjoy the challenge of a realistically scaled Kerbin system. This set of engine configs roughly approximates the weight, size, and perfomance of real life engines without using RO configs. It also contains a patch to make these compatible so that SMURFF doesn't further modify them.
